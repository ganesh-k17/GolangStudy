## Web server and API

### Web server

- The primary role of a web server is to serve web pages for a website.
- If you want to host your web application on the internet, in many cases you will need a web server.
- A web page can be rendered from a single HTML file, or complex assortment of resources fitted together. (such as JS, scripts, CSS files etc.)

### Request response model

- The client sends a request for some data
- and the server responds to the request

```sequence
client->webserver:request
webserver->client:response
```
